# Hierarchical-risk-parity-
 The Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) model is a portfolio optimization fra
mework designed to balance risk contributions across a portfolio. It achieves
 this by constructing a tree-like structure, or dendrogram, that groups assets
 based on their similarity, typically measured using metrics such as correla
tions or other dependence measures.
